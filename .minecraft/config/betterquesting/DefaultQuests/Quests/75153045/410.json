      "desc:8": "Botania is a tech mod themed around natural magic. Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\nBotania\u0027s design philosophy\n\n    No pipes, wires, etc-- they\u0027re boring and overdone;\n    No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n    No numbers-- players shouldn\u0027t try to minmax everything;\n    Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n    Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\nBotania\u0027s goals\n\n    Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n    Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n    Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n    Create an overall immersive experience.\n",
