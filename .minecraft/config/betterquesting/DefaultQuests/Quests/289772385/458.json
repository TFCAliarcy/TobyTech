      "desc:8": "The Wireless Connector is a block added by AE2 Stuff. It acts as a short-distance quantum bridge that is able to transfer up to 32 channels and is able to directly connect to ME Cables. Only two Connectors can be connected to one another via a Wireless Setup Kit. The default AE/t cost can be calculated as AE/t \u003d 10 + distance^2 This connection only needs to be provided on one side, though it will not work across dimensions. ",
