You do this by putting these blocks in your alveary but not in the top row of alveary blocks.\n\nThe Alveary Fan allows you to move the temperature of an alveary down 1 for each powered fan.\n\nThe Alveary Heater allows you to move the temperature of an alveary up 1 for each powered heater.\n\nThe Alveary Hydroregulator allows you to raise or lower the humidity of the alveary 20% by using water or lava respectivly. You can use multiple of them but note that they have a slight effect on the temperature effecting it by 10%\n\nThe Alveary Lighting tricks bees into thinking it is daytime.\n\nThe Rain Shield will make them able to work in the rain.",
