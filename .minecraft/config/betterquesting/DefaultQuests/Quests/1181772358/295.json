      "desc:8": "These farms offer 3 advantages over single block farms.\n\nFirst is that you can use these to farm fruit trees by setting them to be orchard mode.\n\nSecond is that you can mix and match what you want to farm, having 1 side be a tree farm while another is a crop farm.\n\nThird is that they use more of the space they take up, not having the 9x9 hollow space between the farm block and actual farmland.\n\nBelow is a link to the wiki showing how to make the farm as you get a lot of options and it will be best to have visuals.\n\n\n{Embed}TypeLink;https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Multifarm;150;30;Building Multiblock Farm{Embed}\n\nAnd now is time to mention manual vs automatic for multiblock farms. With manual you will have to place down the dirt and crops where you want them whereas an automatic will do so automatically. The exception to this is an orchard where even in automatic you will need to plant them and lay down dirt.\n\nYou set what you farm and in what mode using a circuit board (use intricate) and electron tubes with a soldering iron. You right click a soldering iron to pull up its UI, you can then switch to either managed or manual farm and insert electron tubes in the 4 slots to determine what you farm. To figure out which electron tubes do what search \"electron tube\" in JEI and hold shift over them to see. \n\nOnce you insert the 4 tubes you can put it in the farm where this is a greyed trace of a circuit and you are ready to go if you did all of the information in the steps.\n\nP.S. you may have noticed that you can configure other things with a soldering iron, keep that in mind for those blocks.",
