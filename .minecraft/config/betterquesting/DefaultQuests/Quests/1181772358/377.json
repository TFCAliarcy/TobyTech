      "desc:8": "The trade station is used to put custom trades that people can buy from with a catalogue in any dimension.\n\nWhen opening a trade station you will be prompted to name it which cannot be undone without breaking it so make sure you give it the best name §l§oever§o§r. What follows is how to use it:\n\nThe recieve section is what you want and the larger section to the right the stockpile of what you have gotten. The send section is what you are selling and the larger section to the right of that is the stockpile for selling. You determine the rate of selling/buying by placing the amount you want to buy/sell in their section. \n\nFor example if you want to buy 4 saplings for 6 gold ingots you will put 4 saplings in the receiving section and 6 ingots in the sending section. You then place ingots as a stockpile to the right.\n\nYou will also need to supply it with stamps and paper, you can figure out where these go by shift-clicking them in. Note that stamps work the same as letters and since people can buy in bulk you will want to give a variety of stamps. Next is how buys interact with them:\n\nYou open your catalogue and look for one you wish to buy from and click use. You then open a letter and it will automatically be linked to that trade station, how many items you send will determine how many you receive based the ratio. For example: if you send 24 gold ingots in the previous trade you will receive 16 saplings. You will still have to apply stamps.",
