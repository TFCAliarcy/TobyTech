      "desc:8": "You can cross breed not just bees but also trees. You do this by having bees around trees which will cross pollinate nearby trees causing some of the leaves to change texture which can be seen more easily with spectacles equipped on your head.\n\nDo note that the speed of cross pollinating is based on the bees which have a stat for it making some better than others. You harvest the cross pollinated leaves by breaking them with a grafter.\n\nThere are 3 main purposes for going into arbory:\n\nFirst is that you want the various woods to build with or the trees as decoration.\n\nSecond is for food, Pam\u0027s trees are nowhere near as good as forestry trees for giving food as they are bigger and have more leaves to grow from.\n\nThird are the industrial products from the trees mostly being fruits or nuts. Nuts are used to make seed oil and do so in much greater quantities than regular seeds. Fruits can be turned into juice for biomass more efficiently than water and are quite abundant.\n\nThough note that if you wish to farm them for their fruits you will need to look into multifarms.",
