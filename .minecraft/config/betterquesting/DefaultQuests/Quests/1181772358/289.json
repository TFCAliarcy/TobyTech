      "desc:8": "The Apiary is how you will house bees until you are able to make Alvearies. There are bee houses but they are can neither accept frames nor can you crossbreed for new kinds of bees.\n\nTo get materials from bees you place a princess and drone into an apiary to which will breed to make a queen which follows the breed of the princess. The queen will produce combs over time until it dies which will result in new drones and princesses.\n\nThe three slots in the middle allow you to place frames which have effects on them based on which ones you put in.\n\nBut the real fun begins when you breed a drone and princess of different breeds, the queen will have the same stats as the princess but their offspring will inherit their mixed genes. Each of the offspring will have a active and dormant gene, the active is the one that effects the bees stats and breed, while the dormant is merely held until to potentially be carried onto offspring where it may become active.\n\nYou can think of this like a pennant square, if you have a bee with 2 of gene A and another with gene A and gene B there is a 50% of the offspring getting 2 of gene A, 25% of gene A and B, and 25% of 2 of gene B.\n\nTo the right hand side it will show you the climate which is important as some bees can only live in specific climates based on temperature and humidity.\n\nThe left hand side will show any problems the bee is having such as lacking flowers, it raining, it being an unsuitable climate, or it being night.\n\nNote that for some bees when it says they need flowers it is not refering to flowers but potentially other things whether that be cactus, certain ores, or simply stone.",
