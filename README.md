 To Do:
 
Localization for Quests that lack them

Add quests for things that lack them but deserve them (some spooky stuff should stay hidden)

Integrate GalaxySpace into progression

Use Onslaught to Add Mob Raids

--Figure out how to balance forestry bees (perhaps requiring multiblock for combs of exotic materials)--

Overhaul wyvern armor recipe to require rupter parts

Maybe Anti-matter Reactor (more power than fusion but weaker than draconic)

--Food Overhaul (make hunger filled be the sum of components)--

Balancing of Binnie's Genetics

--Recipe for turning oil into plastic--

--Add Deep Mob support for different mobs (like Remnant)--

Solar Rebalance & Integration
